# NFC-Movie-Cards

Here's our repository for movie designs to be used on NFC cards. The design has been made universal and can be used for kodi-based systems like LibreElec or CoreELEC. 
The back cover has a QR-code that when scanned, takes you to the movies' IMDB page. Here you can watch a trailer and learn all about the movie you want to watch.

If you want to know more about how to use these designs on a Kodi-based system you can go over to the Zaparoo discord and learn about all sorts of cool NFC stuff!
